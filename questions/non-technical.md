# Non technical questions

While interviewing a candidate, one of the elements that I am most interested is the non technical questions 
as it helps me understand its future projection. When you are usually finding to hire a peer, you are looking 
to fill some gaps in short or middle terms but you are looking for long term value for the organisation. This 
is why this set of questions, in particular hiring for a projection to the future are likely to be more important
than other more short-term technical ones.

Non-technical questions falls into understanding categories:

- Understanding motivators: intrinsic (mastery, autonomy and purpose) and extrinsic (compensation, recognition, career)
- Understanding path to learning
- Understanding path to collaboration: within a team, outside of a team (customers and stakeholders)  

## Sample list of questions
