# Entry-level software engineer interview - WIP

Software engineer, software developer or just developer could be used in this doc. 

## Why

You want to have a shallow breadth-first understanding of the candidate.

## What

When doing an interview for entry level, i would be interested
to understand

- General background
- Software engineering background or abilities at the present moment
- Software engineering vision or abilities in the future 

## How - Anatomy of an interview

Assumptions of

- one hour interview
- interviewer and interview candidate

Structure 

- Introduction - 10 mins 
- Understanding software engineering - now - 20-25 mins
- Understanding software engineering - future - 15-20 mins
- Candidate questions 10 mins

### Introduction

A general setup for the interview where to feel comfortable and set background for the two-ways conversation

Interviewer starts by

- introducing its individual context and within the organisation
- introducing the role from the individual aspect and within the wider org context. 

Candidate to introduce in order to understand a bit of its background 

Interviewer to remark the fact that is a two-ways communication channel. 

### Understanding Software Engineering Now

Based on a candidates personal project, to understand  
- from problem statement to solution 
- development approach and practices  

In practice that would translate into 

#### Question 1: From problem statement to solution

From a personal project there are three main questions to walk 

```
What is the problem that you are trying to solve ?
```

```
What are the features that you have developed to solve the problem ?
```

```
What are the steps that you have taken to develop a feature?
```


#### Question 2: Coding in practice by candidate known example

This question takes as an input one of the features that the candidate 
feels comfortable about and 

```
What from the outside-in the different application layers. To determine the purpose 
of each layer and their responsbilities. 
```

For each layer you want to check understanding by layer on candidates. Assuming a 3-tier web application based on

- Experience / Frontend = HTML,CSS, JS/Js Framerowk
- Backend = any 
- Data = any

  
You want to understand for Experience/Frontend layer 

```
What is the HTML structure in place and some of the basic tags.
```

```
How styles are being managed and some feature like overrides or responsivess 
```

```
How is dynamic behaviours is managed by JS or Framework. You want to understand user action lifecycle:
1. user does actions 
2. which being captured by htlm element, javascript
3. executed frontend or backend logic
4. response reflected to user back 
```

You want to understand for Backend layer

```
API Specification 
```

```
Backend design  
```

```
A request/response flow from backend perspective  
```

You want to understand for Data layer

```
Specification and choice 
```

```
Design 
```

```
Based on the previous request/response flow the interaction with the database 
```

```
Using a domain entity, CRUD-style actions reflected into the database 
```

#### Question 3: Development practices


You want to understand given the previous project 

```
Software collaboration practices around git by determining the lifecycle of a code change of a feature
 
```

```
Test-driven development exposure and feature acceptance 
```
